Having trouble getting started?

Think about santas change problem as a set of conditonal statements (if, else if, etc).
When santa delivers to someone and collects payment, what should you check each time?
You will likely want to know how many of each bill you already have from collecting payment from others so you can determine if you have the correct bills to give change!

1. Santa will only accept $5, $10, and $20 bills.

2. You cannot split a bill in half. For example, if someone pays with a $10 and you only have $10. You will take their $10 and they do not get any change.

3. Your goal will be to return a Boolean. You should return True if everyone received their correct change, or False if at least one person did not.
